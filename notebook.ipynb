    "### **Smart Cities Hackathon** (Winter Semester 2022/23)\n",
    "\n",
    "**ID:** Traffic-Monitoring \\\n",
    "**Challange title:** Traffic Monitoring and Pattern Detection via Realistic Traffic Modeling Simulation for Smart Cities \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "**Description:** Cities are living organisms. This can be interpreted by observing the city traffic that has developed over the years. Increasing job demands, changing housing and other social needs have made us more dependent on smart mobility. Low-carbon transport alternatives are especially crucial in developed countries, as they have densely populated metropolitan areas and are heavily dependent on industries and transportation infrastructures that use fossil fuels. For example, the USA, Canada, Japan and Western Europe are home to 8.8% of the world's population but are responsible for 21.6% of greenhouse gas emissions. (Based on data published at [1,2]) Therefore, developing smart mobility solutions in cities is more than a choice. The best starting point for solving this problem is to first conduct a careful statistical analysis of the traffic data (e.g. [3]).\\\n",
    "For this Hackathon, you will have a comprehensive traffic model (similar to the example in the [4]) constructed for Eclipse MOSAIC and SUMO. This allows you to analyze mixed traffic scenarios involving connected vehicles and infrastructures. It enables you to develop traffic models or algorithms to detect traffic patterns and anomalies. Based on real traffic status, some information can be transmitted through connected vehicles and RSUs, which may regulate the traffic flow. Thus, it may also be possible to make an environment-aware or safety-focus traffic planning.\\\n",
    "The main task in this assignment is to develop a monitoring system for traffic flow and an advisory model for traffic congestions. Evaluation will be made according to the sophistication and performance of the model providing meaningful insights derived from the datasets. This dataset is generated from Eclipse MOSAIC simulation logs. The data recorded in these logs are widespread types of data required for traffic analysis systems of next level smart cities [5,6 and 7].\n",

    "Please read the following reminders:\n",
    "- If you have already installed the necessary software and packages/libraries, you are ready to run the simulation.\n",
    "- If not, please visit [link](https://github.com/ide3a/installation-guide) to quickly install the required software/packages. Unlike the workshop, please check your Java version by typing `java --version`, you should be using the `openjdk 11.X.X` version. If you have an older or newer version, please uninstall this version and install [JDK11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11) from the link. Otherwise you may not be able to run the simulation or you may get unexpected errors.\n",
    "- If you are a Windows user, remember to set **JAVA_HOME** as the environment variable. You will see the same warning in the [related link](https://github.com/ide3a/installation-guide).\n",
    "- In Jupyter Lab, go to the terminal, run the following command according to your operating system.\n",
    "**Note:** If you don't see the terminal button, you can open a new launcher from the `File` tab in the menu, then click the `Terminal` button"

    "<em><strong>Hint 1:</strong></em> The `-v` option is to start the visualization, with this option you can see a visualization of the simulation in a new window.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "<em><strong>Hint 2:</strong></em> If you want to change the simulatino speed, add `-b` option with a number. For example: `-b 1` is for realtime simulation speed, or larger numbers are for faster simulation.  \n",
    "\\\n",
    "<em><strong>Hint 3:</strong></em> As soon as the simulation starts running, you will see the information on the terminal. You will notice how long the total simulation time is. This will allow you to write code simultaneously without stopping the simulation. While the simulation is running in the background, you can get the necessary data from the server and test the concept you have designed. "
